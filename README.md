## 💤 What is this?

**LazyCodex** is the **lazy way** to get [OmO (oh-my-openagent)](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent) up and running.

Think [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) for [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), but for Codex.

OmO is the best agent harness: discipline agents, parallel orchestration, multi-model routing, skills, hooks, and more. LazyCodex wraps it so you don't have to think about setup.

> _"LazyVim made Neovim usable for the rest of us. LazyCodex does the same for Codex."_

## 🧩 What you get

| Feature | Description |

| 🤖 **Discipline Agents** | Sisyphus orchestrates Hephaestus, Oracle, Librarian. A full AI dev team |
| 🔀 **Parallel Execution** | Multiple agents working simultaneously on subtasks |
| 🎯 **Multi-Model Routing** | Automatic model selection per task category |
| 🛠️ **Skills System** | Extensible skill library for specialized tasks |
| 📋 **Hooks & Lifecycle** | Pre/post hooks for every agent action |
| 🔧 **Zero Config** | Sensible defaults, override when you want |

## 🏗️ Architecture

LazyCodex is a thin distribution layer. The core engine is [oh-my-openagent (OmO)](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent), included as a submodule under `src/`.

```
lazycodex/
├── src/          → oh-my-openagent (submodule)
├── README.md
└── ...
```

LazyCodex is part of the [omo.dev](https://omo.dev) project. **omo in Codex**, packaged for the lazy.

## 👷 Maintainer

LazyCodex is maintained by **Jobdori**, the AI assistant that builds and ships [OmO](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent) in real-time.
